## Dataset
[Dataset Name](https://www.example.com/link-to-dataset)

## Why did I chose this dataset?

I chose this dataset because I am very interested in nature and I love animals. I am also curious to see how different each animal is.

## Progress
- [x] Picked dataset
- [x] Defined 10 questions
- [x] Answered 10 questions using Pandas
- [x] Added at least one data visualization (using Matplotlib and/or Seaborn) to each single question
- [x] Prepared presentation slides to present at graduation

## Questions
- [x] Question 1: What are the top 5 longest living animals? (bar chart)
  - Answer: he Hagfish, blobfish, Galapagos tortoise, and Tuatara are the longest living animals from the chart. This shows a mix of sea creatures and reptiles showcasing long lifespans. Each of these animals have slow metabolism, which is linked to longer lifespans.

- [x] Question 2: How many animals live in each habitat? (bar chart)
  - Answer: There are numerous habitats, but rainforests are the home to most of the animals. Oceans are second place, but rainforests show a clear margin that they provide the necessary habitat and conditions for the most animals.

- [x] Question 3: What color is most common between the animals? (pie chart)
  - Answer: Simple colors are the most common among the animals, for example colors like white, black, and brown are most commonly found.

- [x] Question 4: Most common diet? (pie chart)
  - Answer: The most common diet among the animals was a carnivore diet. Around 36% are carnivores, showing that a large portion of animals rely on the food chain and hunting/feeding off of other species.

- [x] Question 5: Most common social structure? (pie chart)
  - Answer:  Amongst the animals in the dataset, most animals tend to live alone. This shows that most animals don't need to hunt in packs or pods. This also shows that most of the animals' preference is to spend most of its life on its own. They probably start to live on their own after they grow up and seperate from their parents.

- [x] Question 6: What portion of animals are endagered? (bar chart)
  - Answer: Most of the animals in this dataset are not endangered. The table shows around 40 of them are while 70 aren't. This is good news that most of the animals are not endangered, but it is also worrying that there are still a lot of species that are endangered and threatened.

- [x] Question 7: Which country has the most animals? (dot plot)
  - Answer: South America appears to have the most animals. This is not surprising because South America has many rainforests, and as mentioned previously, rainforests were the most common habitat to the animals from this dataset. This shows that many animals thrive off of rainy habitats filled with lots of vegetation around them.

- [x] Question 8: Longest pregnancy period? (bar chart)
  - Answer: The humpback whale is shown to have the longest gestation period. It shows that when a humpback whale gets pregnant, the full cycle lasts around a whole year. I believe this is because humpback whales are very large and require a lot of time and energy for the baby humpback whale to develop.

- [x] Question 9: fastest animals? (lollipop chart)
  - Answer: The fastest animal from the dataset is the bald eagle. I believe its ability to fly makes this possible, as they are very aerodynamic and quick. Second place is the well known cheetah, as these animals are known to being very quick and fast in order for them to be able to hunt their prey. Both of these animals hunt their food, so they require speed to be able to catch their prey.

- [x] Question 10: Which predator is most common? (bar chart)
  - Answer:The chart shows that humans are the most common predators. This shows that humans depend a lot on eating many varieties of different animals. This is quite shocking to me because I believed that a lion or tiger would be at the top of this list. I did not expect humans to be that big of an impact on all of these animals.
